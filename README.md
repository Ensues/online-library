## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to improve the online presence of the library at the College of Computer Studies. The existing library site is limited in functionality, mainly featuring a small collection of popular books and theses. Our redesigned version aims to provide a better-looking and more intuitive interface, although the current resources are still limited.

## Target Audience

The website is intended for:
- **Students** interested in browsing library resources.
- **General visitors** who want to explore the library's offerings.
- **Anyone** with an interest in viewing available books and theses.

## Features

- **Revamped User Interface** - A modernized design that improves visual appeal compared to the old version.
- **Basic Book Gallery** - Displays popular books and theses, similar to the previous site.
- **Catalog Dropdown** - Allows users to filter the gallery by popular books or theses (limited categories at the moment).
- **Book Reading Availability** - Users can view information on books and theses available for in-person reading, connecting the digital platform to the physical library collection.
- **Login and Guest Access** - Students can log in with their accounts, or users can browse the site as a guest.

    Note: The login button is currently enabled only when the email and password fields contain **any** input.

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Tools**:
  - **IDE** - Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
  - **Version Control** - GitHub

## Installation and Usage

The site is publicly accessible and does not require any special setup for browsing. Students can log in with their credentials for a more personalized experience, while visitors can access the library as guests.

This project was developed specifically for the hackathon, so further development is not currently planned.
